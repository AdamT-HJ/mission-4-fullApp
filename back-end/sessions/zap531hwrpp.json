It'll cover theft, accidents, and damage to other vehicles or property, offering good protection for your asset.\n\nHowever, just to confirm, is it a standard sedan or something more specialized, such as a racing car or modified performance vehicle?  Also, do you foresee a high likelihood of mechanical breakdowns given its age and usage?\n"

With that level of customization, and given that it's a modified vehicle,  Comprehensive Car Insurance might not be easily obtainable, and MBI is unfortunately not available for racing cars.  It might be more difficult to find a provider to insure it, and the premium would likely be very high if you do find one.  We might need to explore other avenues depending on the exact nature of the modifications and the insurer's underwriting criteria.\n\nCan you tell me more about the modifications?  Knowing the specifics could help me assess whether comprehensive coverage is even possible for your vehicle, or if we need to explore third party options.  A third-party policy would only cover damage you cause to others, but wouldn't cover damage to your vehicle itself.\n"

Comprehensive and MBI are definitely out of the question.  Even third-party insurance would likely be rejected by most providers due to the significant liability risks associated with such modifications. You would likely need to seek specialized insurance for vehicles of this nature, and I'm not familiar with those specific providers.  I would advise contacting specialist insurers who cater to high-risk vehicles or those with unconventional modifications.  I unfortunately can't advise further on this specific type of insurance, as it's far outside my expertise.\n"

With the machine guns removed,  a standard sedan, three years old, and worth $90,000,  Comprehensive Car Insurance remains the most suitable option. It protects your investment and covers you for liability to others. However, the modifications might still affect the premium.\n\n\nIs there anything else I should know about the modifications?  Any performance enhancements or structural changes that aren't standard for a similar model and year?  This information will help determine how much the modifications might increase your premium.\n"

This will help to avoid any issues later on if you need to make a claim. Do you have any other questions?\n"

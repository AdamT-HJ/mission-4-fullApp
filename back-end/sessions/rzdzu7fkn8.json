It will cover theft, accidents, and damage to other vehicles or property.  However, we should also consider if you want Mechanical Breakdown Insurance (MBI).  Given the value of your car and the potential for expensive repairs down the line, MBI might be worth looking into, although it's a significant additional cost.  Do you have any thoughts on MBI or would you like more information on it?\n"

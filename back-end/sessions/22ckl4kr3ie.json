For example:\n\n* **What kind of insurance are you looking for?** (e.g., health, auto, home, life, renters, etc.)\n* **What's your budget?**  (A general range is fine.)\n* **What are your priorities?** (e.g., low premiums, comprehensive coverage, specific benefits, etc.)\n* **What's your age and location?** (This helps determine rates.)\n* **Do you have any pre-existing conditions (if applicable)?** (For health insurance)\n\nThe more information you provide, the better I can assist you.\n"

To help me find the best options for you, please tell me:\n\n* **What type of car do you drive?** (Make, model, and year)  This affects your premiums.\n* **What is your driving history?** (Have you had any accidents or tickets in the past few years?  What's your driving record like?)  This is a major factor in determining your rates.\n* **Where do you live?** (Your location affects insurance rates.)\n* **How much coverage are you looking for?** (Liability only?  Comprehensive and collision?  Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage?)\n* **What is your budget?** (Knowing your price range will help me narrow down the options.)\n* **Do you have any existing insurance policies?** (If you're switching companies, this is important information.)\n\nOnce I have this information, I can give you a more informed recommendation.\n"

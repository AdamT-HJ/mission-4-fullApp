Because it's an Audi,  you might also want to consider Mechanical Breakdown Insurance (MBI).  Audis, while luxurious, can have expensive repairs. MBI could save you a substantial amount if a major mechanical failure occurs.  However,  it's a significant upfront cost, so weigh the pros and cons based on your budget and risk tolerance.  Do you have any questions about either option before I give a final recommendation?\n"

While comprehensive is *generally* recommended for vehicles over $5,000,  since yours is right at the threshold, let's re-evaluate.  Given its age and value,  the cost of comprehensive insurance might be significant compared to third-party.  In this case,  a third-party policy with fire and theft coverage could be a more cost-effective option, offering some protection against theft and fire damage. However, it's still important to consider your financial ability to replace the car in case of a major incident. Would you be able to afford that?\n"

It will cover theft, accidental damage to your vehicle, and also protect you financially if you cause damage to another person's property or vehicle. Given the value of your car, the added protection of comprehensive coverage is well worth considering.\n"

However, it's more of an add-on than a replacement for comprehensive insurance.  Think of comprehensive as the essential protection, covering accidents and theft, while MBI acts as a safety net for unexpected mechanical issues.\n\nThe cost of MBI can be substantial, ranging from $1000 to over $4000 for a multi-year policy.  Whether it's worthwhile depends on your risk tolerance and the potential cost of major repairs.  For a luxury coupe, a breakdown could easily lead to thousands of dollars in repair bills, making MBI a potentially valuable investment.  However, it's crucial to carefully review the policy exclusions; many things aren't covered.\n"

Given your car's value and the potential for expensive repairs on a higher-end vehicle, MBI *could* be beneficial.  However,  the cost is significant, and many repairs aren't covered.\n\nI can't definitively say whether or not it's the right choice for you, as that's a personal financial decision.  Weigh the cost of the policy against the potential savings if you experience a major mechanical failure.  If you're uneasy about the possibility of unexpected high repair bills, the peace of mind MBI offers might be worth the price.  If you're more comfortable taking on that financial risk, it might be unnecessary.\n"

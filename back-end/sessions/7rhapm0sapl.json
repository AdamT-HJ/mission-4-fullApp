And  do you use it for business, or is it just for personal use?\n"

Because of the modifications and the implied higher risk,  Mechanical Breakdown Insurance (MBI) isn't suitable for your vehicle.  Also, given the modifications, standard Comprehensive Car Insurance might be tricky to obtain and may cost more.  Therefore, I recommend Third Party Car Insurance. This will protect you if you're responsible for an accident causing damage to another vehicle or property.  It doesn't cover damage to your own vehicle, but given the modifications, it might be the most sensible option. Does that sound right to you?  We can discuss other options if you'd prefer.\n"
